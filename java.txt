#data types in java 
primitive and non primitive 
primitive 
=>char- where we used to store chareacter like 'a' 'b' 'c' etc... 
 in chareacter any chareacter can be stored but not in form like "ab". 
=>bytes- where we used to store values like 1, 4, 5, 7 etc...
note byte data type can store variales upto [-128 to 127] total=256.
=> boolean variable is used to declare true or false 
   it can store only true or false.
=>float 
  float is used to store variables in decimal format eg. 10.5

********************************************************************
taking input from the user
to take input from the user there are three typre they are:- 
next()
nextline()
for more details refer to the ss attached to the=his folder


*******************************************************************
type conversion 
in java you can convert 
int to float, double and long 
but you cannot convert long to int and booolean and son on becase the value which wiil being stored
can be less or greatear than  original value 
matlab destination value should be more than original value 
*here value bole toh 1 value ki memory *
for eg 1 int value takes a capacity of 4bytes 
and long takes memory of 8 bytes so conversion can be made but it cannnot perforn vice-versa
in short order goes as follows 
byte-> int-> float-> long->double 

**********************************************************
OPERATORS IN JAVA 

symbos that tells compiler to perform operation 
for eg 
sum= a+b
here a and b are the operands 
and + sign is an OPERATOR

types of operators 
arithmatic (binary/uniary)
logical 
relational  
bitwise 
assgnment 

In arithmaticoperators there are two types
they are 
binary two operands 
unary single 

binary ka matlab hota hai two
yani two operands chahiye hota hai jaise ki a aur b.
 unary operators
 in unary OPERATOR there are od two types
 (a=a+1)
 pre increment (++a)
 Pre decrement (--a)
 post increment (a++)
 post decrement (a--)

loops
while mai condition pehle dekte aur kam hota hai
do while loop mai pehle kam hota hai fir cindition dekta hai 
for loop

//////////////////////////////
Arrays 
an array is like a memory storing only same type of elements
foe example if an int elements is entered the int will be stores in that array any string value cannot be stored
it is placed on a contigious location 
//////////////////////////////
operation in arrays 
create 
input
output 
update

for trapping rain water refer physical notes

java mai 2 types ka variables hai 
1 object type 
2 variable type ya primitive type 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
object oriented programming 
java mai class ka nam ka 1st letter capital mai hoga aur functions ka nam ka letter chota hoga
